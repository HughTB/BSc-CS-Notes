### Law and Rules

- Commutative Law:
 - A+B = B+A
 - A.B = B.A
- Associative Law:
 - A+(B+C) = (A+B)+C
 - A.(B.C) = (A.B).C
- Distributive Law:
 - A.(B+C) = A.B + A.C
- DeMorgan's Theorems:
 - (A'.B')' = A+B
 - (A'+B')' = A.B
  
- Rule 1: A+0 = A
- Rule 2: A+1 = 1
- Rule 3: A.0 = 0
- Rule 4: A.1 = A
- Rule 5: A+A = A
- Rule 6: A.A = A
- Rule 7: A+A' = 1
- Rule 8: A.A' = 0
- Rule 9: (A')' = A
- Rule 10: A + A.B = A
- Rule 11: A + A'.B = A+B
- Rule 12: (A+B).(A+C) = A+B.C (Extended Distributive Rule)
  
A + A'.B -> A + A.B + A'.B -> A + B.(A+A') -> A + B.1 -> A + B  
So A + A'.B = A + B
