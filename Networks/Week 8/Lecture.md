### Cables

- Different types of media can all transmit the same data
- Cables are in layer 1 of the OSI model
- There are 3 different types of cabling:
    - Twisted-pair cabling
    - Coaxial cabling
    - Fibre-optic cabling
- Wireless communication such as:
    - Satellite Comms
    - Radar
    - Cellular
    - GPS
    - Infrared
    - WLAN (Wi-Fi)
    - Bluetooth
- In a wired network, there is usually a networking rack on each floor, that contains a patch panel or switch, which all of the network ports on that floor are connected to
- The network designer has to decide which sort of media to use for each connection, depending upon
    - The required bandwidth (including future growth)
    - The level of electrical interference
    - The maximum length of cabling that will be needed
    - Cost of the media
- Unshielded twisted-pair cables
    - The least expensive type of media
    - Can be used up to 100m
    - Data capacity defined by EIA/TIA 568
    - Cat3 supports up to 10Mbps
    - Cat4 20Mbps
    - Cat5 100Mbps
    - Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a and above are used for 1000Mbps and above
    - A UTP cable consists of 8 conductors twisted into 4 pairs
    - They are terminated in an RJ-45 connector
- Multiplexing can be used to combine multiple signals to be sent across one physical medium
- This can be used to reduce the number of cables needed
- Cat6 cabling
    - The newest type of UTP cabling
    - There are few differences between Cat6 and Cat5e, mostly increasing the quality of signal
    - There are 2 forms of Cat6
        - UTP or ScTP (Screened Twisted Pair)
        - ScTP has an additional layer of metallic foil to improve its resilience to interference
        - Cat7 and Cat8 are SSTP (Screen Shielded Twisted Pair) or SFTP (Screened Foiled Twisted Pair)
- Coaxial cabling
    - Low noise (low error rate)
    - Used to be used in a variety of applications
        - In IBM networks
        - In early ethernet (limited to 10Mbps)
    - The shielding may include multiple layers of foil or braid
- Fibre-Optic cabling
    - Used for extremely high bandwidths
        - Up to multiple Terabits per second, if using high-grade fibre
        - Many times more bandwidth than typical twisted-pair cabling
    - Typically formed of two individual fibres, each of which transmits only in one direction
    - They need to convert the electrical signals to optical signals and back
    - Not susceptible to electromagnetic interference as signals are sent as light, not electrical signals
    - Very thin glass strands
        - Multimode fibre is on the order of 50 microns
        - Singlemode fibre is on the order of 10 microns
    - The actual fibre cabling costs roughly the same as high-grade twisted pair cabling, but the connectors needed on either end are rather expensive, depending upon the type of connector, and the device it's connecting to
    - Media converters are needed on each end of the fibre cable, and depending upon the device it's connecting to, and the bandwidth needed, they can be rather expensive
- Wireless communication
    - Television and Radio
    - Satellite Comms
    - Radar
    - Mobile Telephone System (Cellular Communication)
    - GPS (Global Positioning System)
    - Infrared Communication (needs line of sight and has low bandwidth)
    - WLAN (Wi-Fi) - IEEE 802.11
    - Bluetooth
    - Cordless landline phones
    - RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)
    - NFC (Near Field Communication)
