## Network Policies and Standards

### The Internet Society

- Aims to oversee the standardisation of protocols, improving global interoperability
- Coordinates Internet
  - Design
  - Engineering
  - Management
- The society has 3 main sections
  - Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
    - Defines the architecture of the internet
  - Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
    - Defines the protocols of the internet, based upon the architecture given by the IAB
  - Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)
    - Technical management
    - Defines the "internet standard"
- Working groups investigate the actual details of any and all proposed standards and protocols
  - Draft version is created
  - Given out for consultation
  - The IESG gives final approval
  - Published as a Request for Comments (RFC)
    - If the draft hasn't progressed in 6 months, it is withdrawn
- The criteria for all standards
  - Be clear
  - Be technically competent
  - Have multiple independent but interoperable implementations
  - Gain significant public support (both users and manufacturers)
  - Be useful
- The process
  - Draft made of the standard
  - The standard is proposed, and left open for 6 months for comments
  - If the standard is relevant and correct, it becomes a draft standard and left open for 4 months
  - If the standard is still relevant and no errors are found, it becomes an internet standard
  - When the standard becomes irrelevant, it becomes a historical standard
- For a standard to be ratified, it needs to have two independently developed implementations that are fully interoperable
  - Once it is ratified, it is given a STD number and RFC number

### International Standards Organisation (ISO)

- The ISO aims to promote standardisation and related activities to facilitate international exchange of information and services
  - Provides standards for all sorts of things, including networks and other electronics
- 6 step development process
  - Proposal Stage
    - A new proposal is assigned to a working group, who create a proposal for the standard
  - Prepatory Stage
    - A working group creates the draft of the standard
    - Once created, it is passed to the committee for the public consensus phase
  - Committee Stage
    - Registered at the ISO central Secretariat
    - Distributed for balloting and comments
    - Once a census is achieved, it becomes a Draft International Standard (DIS)
  - Enquiry Stage
    - DIS is sent to all ISO bodies
    - Time limit of 5 months for voting and approval
    - It becomes a Final Draft International Standard
    - If not approved it is returned to the working group to be reworked
  - Approval Stage
    - Redistributed for final acceptance
    - 2 month time limit
    - Technical comments are no longer considered
    - If not approved it is returned to the working group to be reworked
  - Final Stage
    - Once approved, it becomes an International Standard
    - Some minor editorial changes are allowed before final publication

### Telecommunications Standardisation Sector (ITU)

- UN specialised agency
- Members are governments
- Responsible for broadband standards based upon ATM technology
- Processes
  - Works in 4 year cycles
  - Meetings of world telecommunication standardisation conference
  - Work program for the next cycle established
  - Study groups are created and abolished
  - There is an accelerated procedure allowing recommendations to be approved when they are ready
- Ballot Process
  - Wide participation by Governments, Users and Industrial representatives
  - This causes significant delays
  - Because of this, it is now being streamlined by majority rule ballot

### Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)

- Initiating a project
  - Sponsors input to create a collaborative group
  - A Project Authorisation Request (PAR) is produced
- Once a PAR is approved,
  - A working group is created
  - They work to write standards
  - Anyone can be included in the group
- Drafting the standard
  - The first draft is written
  - The Mandatory Editorial Coordinator checks the draft
  - Then it goes to ballot
- Balloting process
  - Once the standard is stable
  - The sponsor creates balloting groups
    - Anyone is able to comment upon the standard
  - Balloting group consists of
    - Producers
    - Users
    - Government
    - General internet users
  - Balloting lasts 30-60 days
  - Decisions
    - Approval
    - Disapproval
    - Abstain
    - Consensus is 75% respondents with 75% group approval
- Gaining approval
  - The IEEE-SA board approves or denies the final standard
  - The board's decision is based upon recommendations by the committee
  - Standards are valid for 5 years, after which they can be
    - Reaffirmed
    - Revised
    - Withdrawn
