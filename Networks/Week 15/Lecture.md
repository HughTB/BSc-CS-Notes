## Network Security

### Key Elements

- Security Attack - Any action that compromises the security of information
- Security Mechanism - A mechanism that is designed to detect, prevent or recover from an attack
- Security Service - A service that enhances the security of data processing systems and information transfers, usually making use of more than one security mechanism

### Security Goals

- Confidentiality - Keeping the information private
- Integrity - Preventing the information from changing
- Authentication - Ensuring the information is from a known source

### Security Attacks

- Interruption - Data does not flow to the destination
- Interception - Data flows to the destination, as well as a 3rd party
- Modification - Data is intercepted and changed before reaching it's destination
- Fabrication - Data is fabricated and sent to the destination, without any interaction from the source

### Passive Threats

- Passive attacks are listening in on transmissions
- The goal of the attacker is to obtain information that is being transmitted

### Active Threats

- Attempt to actively cause harm, often through system faults or errors, or using brute force attacks
- May attempt to overload victim's computers to the point of unusability or crashes (known as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks)

### Security Services

- Access control
  - Levels of access
  - Some people may need write access, others may not
- Availability
  - Denial of Service Attacks
  - Viruses that delete files

### Methods of Defence

- Encryption
  - Transforming the data in such a way that only people who have been given a piece of information are able to read it
- Software Controls
  - Access control used to limit user access to a database
  - Operating system controls used to limit user access to other users and their information
- Hardware Controls
  - Smartcards used to access data
  - Biometrics such as finger prints or retinal scans required to access data
- Policies and Procedures
  - Frequent password changes
  - Strong password requirements
- Physical Controls
  - Limit physical access to computers that can access information, or the servers the information is stored on

### Security Vulnerabilities

- Securing network communication has always been a problem
- It is hard to secure the initial requests
- The data needs to be protected at all times when it is in transit
- Users need to be trusted before they are given access
