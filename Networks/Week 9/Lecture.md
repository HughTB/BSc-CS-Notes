### Communication Circuit Design

- Things to consider when designing a network:
    - What is the maximum data rate needed
    - What is the maximum length a single run of cable is required to be
    - Could there be an issue with electrical interference
    - What constraints are there with the cable runs
        - Listed buildings
        - Client requirements
        - etc
    - What are the major costs associated with the selected medium
    - What medium is the external connection (e.g. broadband, fibre, etc)
- Dial-up
    - Dial-up is available in two forms
        - Analogue (Mostly legacy, not everywhere)
        - Digital
    - Analogue links require a digital-to-analogue modem - this converts the digital signals from your computer to analogue signals
    - Digital links require a digital-to-digital modem - this converts the digital signals from your computer to a different digital signal to be sent over the phone line
- Modulation
    - Modulation converts a digital signal into an analogue signal, which can be sent across an analogue connection
    - Demodulation converts the analogue signal back into a digital signal, which can be used by a computer
    - Modem stands for **Mo**dulation **dem**odulation
    - Standard modem speeds are as such:
        - V.34 at 28.8 or 33.6 kbps
        - V.90 at 56 kbps
        - V.92 allows higher-speed connections and the ability to accept an incoming call
- Reasons to switch to digital
    - Computers are inherently digital, so easier to convert to a digital communication standard
    - Higher data rates are available
    - Easier to switch
    - Better error rate
        - Noise is not amplified along the line
- Digital telephone communication channels are available
    - Each channel communicates at either 56 or 64 kbps
    - These channels are then multiplexed (combined together) to create higher data rate connections
- Problems with E1/T1 and T3/E3 systems
    - T1 is used in the US and Japan but is incompatible with E1 which is used in Europe and the rest of the world
    - It is complicated to add or remove a channel to convert between the two
    - There is a need for higher bandwidth
    - A new standard is needed
- SONET/SDH
    - Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) is a North American standard
        - Works in multiples of 51.84 Mbps
        - STS-3 supports triple the bandwidth (155.52 Mbps)
        - Multiples of 4 up to 40 Gbps
    - Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) is an international standard
        - Works in multiples of 155 Mbps
    - A very resilient form of SONET and SDH is the dual ring, where there is a ring in both directions
        - If a cable is cut or goes down, the nodes at the ends reroute the data back along the ring in the other direction
        - This recovery happens in 50 milliseconds
