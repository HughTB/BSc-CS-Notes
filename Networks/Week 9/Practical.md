- If you have the following equation, $s(t) = 10.5\sin(100\pi t) + 8.25\sin(200\pi t) + 6.5\sin(300\pi t)$, you can get the following information just by reading the components:
    - The amplitude of the signal is the greatest multiple, in this case, $A = 10.5$
    - The frequency of each component is derived by dividing the value in the brackets by $2\pi$, e.g. $f_1 = \frac{100\pi}{2\pi} = 50Hz$
    - The period of each component is $T = \frac{1}{f}$, using the previously calculated value for $f$
    - The bandwidth is the difference between the highest and lowest frequency, e.g. $Bandwidth = f_{min} - f_{max}$
    - Attenuation can be calculated using $10^{\frac{db}{20}}$ where $db$ is the power attenuation
