### A system of learning by thinking (Construction)

- Methods of study used at college and school typically do not work too well at uni for various reasons
- Read / watch as many introductory videos or books to build up the basic knowledge to expand on with further learning
- Expand on each concept by varying the objective, e.g. change what a loop does and test it multiple times in different ways to build knowledge of that specific "topic"
- Go back to previous concepts to reinforce your knowledge of them, slowly building your overall knowldege
- Be active about learning; don't just wait to be told how to do something, find out yourself
- Only move on to a new concept once you are happy that you understand the current one
- Generate meaning from any small piece of knowledge
- Pick out small pieces of knowledge from lectures, and only write it down if it has meaning

- If you don't master the basic concepts before moving on to more advanced concepts, you will struggle as you have to go back and re-learn previous concepts while learning something entirely new - cognitive overload
- Having a strong grasp of the basic knowledge makes it much easier to learn new concepts, and will make you more confident when learning new and more complex concepts, as you realise that a lot of them are a variation of more basic knowlege
