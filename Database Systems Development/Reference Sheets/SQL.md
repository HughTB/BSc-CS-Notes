# DSD Reference Sheet - SQL

## Data Types

- The following are data types available in PostgreSQL, other DBMSs may use alternative names

|Name|Description|
|-|-|
|`INT`|32-bit integer|
|`BIGINT`|64-bit integer|
|`SERIAL`|32-bit integer, automatically increments if a row is inserted without this attribute being specified. Useful for IDs|
|`BIGSERIAL`|Same as `SERIAL`, but using 64-bit integer|
|`DECIMAL(m,n)`|Decimal number, m places in total, n places after the decimal place. e.g. `DECIMAL(5,3)` would have 2 places before and 3 after the decimal place|
|`MONEY`|Fixed-point decimal number, 2 places after the decimal place. Formats differently depending upon the locale settings of the DBMS, outputs in the format `Â£X.XX`|
|`CHAR(n)`|Fixed-length string, n characters with blank padding if the value has less than n characters|
|`VARCHAR(n)`|Variable-length string with limit, n|
|`TEXT`|Variable-length string with "no limit". Not advised as limit is defined by the operating system the DBMS is running on|
|`BYTEA`|Byte array of unlimited length|
|`TIMESTAMP`|Both date and time, defaults to ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MI:SS) and UTC time zone|
|`DATE`|Just date, defaults to ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)|
|`TIME`|Just time, defaults to ISO 8601 format (HH:MI:SS), may include time zone (HH:MI:SS +-HH:MM)|
|`BOOLEAN`|Boolean, can be input as true/false, yes/no, on/off, 1/0. All result in the same internal value|

## DDL Commands

- `CREATE`
  - This is used to create parts of a database, such as the database itself, and tables within the database
  - ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE example_database;
    ```
    - This creates a new database with the name "example_database"
  - ```sql
    CREATE TABLE example_table (
      example_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      [...]
    );
    ```
    - This example would create a new table with the name "example_table" and with one attribute, "example_id"
- `DROP`
  - This is used to remove databases from a DBMS or tables from a database
  - ```sql
    DROP DATABASE example_database;
    ```
    - This will remove the database "example_database"
    - If the user has permission over the database, *the database will be removed permanently and without confirmation*
  - ```sql
    DROP TABLE example_table;
    ```
    - This will remove the table "example_table"
    - If the user has permission over the database that contains the table, *the table will be removed permanently and without confirmation*
- `ALTER TABLE`
  - This can be used to change many different aspects of an existing table
  - ```sql
    ALTER TABLE example_table
    ADD email char(255);
    ```
    - This example would add a new column named "email" to the existing table "example_table"
  - ```sql
    ALTER TABLE example_table
    DROP COLUMN email;
    ```
    - This would drop or remove the column named "email" from the existing table "example_table"
    - If the user has permission over the database which contains the table, *the column will be removed permanently and without confirmation*
  - ```sql
    ALTER TABLE example_table
    RENAME COLUMN email TO customer_email;
    ```
    - This would rename the column "email" to "customer_email" in the existing table "example_table"
  - ```sql
    ALTER TABLE example_table
    RENAME TO new_example_table;
    ```
    - This would change the name of the table "example table" to "new_example_table"
  - ```sql
    ALTER TABLE example_table
    ALTER COLUMN customer_email TYPE varchar(255);
    ```
    - This would change the data type of the "customer_email" column in the table "example_table" to a `varchar(255)`
    - This syntax is specific to PostgreSQL, as it was not originally part of the SQL standard

## DML Commands

- `SELECT`
  - Used to retrieve data from a database
  - ```sql
    SELECT * FROM example_table;
    ```
    - This would return every column of every record in the table "example_table"
  - ```sql
    SELECT id, email FROM example_table;
    ```
    - This would return only the "id" and "email" columns from every record in the table "example_table"
  - ```sql
    SELECT * FROM example_table
    WHERE id = 32;
    ```
    - This would return every column in the table "example_table", but only records where "id" is equal to 32
  - ```sql
    SELECT * FROM example_table
    WHERE email LIKE "%@gmail.com";
    ```
    - This would return every record from the table "example_table" where the email column ends with "@gmail.com"
  - ```sql
    SELECT * FROM example_table
    WHERE email LIKE "hugh.baldwin%";
    ```
    - This would return every record from the table "example_table" where the email column starts with "hugh.baldwin";
  - ```sql
    SELECT * FROM example_table
    LIMIT 5;
    ```
    - This would return every column of the first 5 records in the table "example_table"
  - ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT email FROM example_table;
    ```
    - This would return every unique email address in the table "example_table"
  - ```sql
    SELECT id AS "User ID", email AS "Email Address" FROM example_table;
    ```
    - This would return the id and email columns from the table "example_table", but with their column headings changed to "User ID" and "Email Address respectively
  - ```sql
    SELECT u.id, u.email, u.address1 FROM user u;
    ```
    - This would return the id, email and address1 columns from the table "user". This query uses aliases to make it easier to reference columns from specific tables. While this is not needed in this query, it is useful when dealing with multiple tables, especially where columns in different tables have the same name
- `INSERT`
  - Used to insert new records into a database
  - ```sql
    INSERT INTO example_table (id, email) VALUES (420, "up2157117@myport.ac.uk");
    ```
    - This would insert a new record into the table "example_table", with the values 420 and "up2157117@myport.ac.uk" in columns id and email respectively
  - ```sql
    INSERT INTO example_table (id, email) VALUES
      (123, "example@example.com"),
      (456, "bob@bobbuildingco.com");
    ```
    - This would insert two new records into the table "example_table". Using this method, you can insert any number of records at one time without having to specify the columns for every new record
  - ```sql
    INSERT INTO example_table (email) VALUES
      ("example@example.com"),
      ("bob@bobbuildingco.com");
    ```
    - This would insert two new records into the table "example_table". Since the id column of example_table is of the type `SERIAL`, it is unnecessary to manually set the id, and would in fact cause issues as the DBMS would not know that the id number has already been used
- `UPDATE`
  - Used to update existing records in a database
  - ```sql
    UPDATE example_table
    SET email = "example2@example.com"
    WHERE id = 32;
    ```
    - This would set the email column of any records with the id 32 to "example2@example.com" in the table "example_table"
  - **Don't forget to specify a `WHERE` clause, else every record in the table will be changed to the new value *permanently and without confirmation***
- `DELETE`
  - Used to remove existing records from a database
  - ```sql
    DELETE FROM example_table
    WHERE id = 32;
    ```
    - This would remove every record with the id 32 from the table "example_table"
  - **Don't forget to specify a `WHERE` clause, else every record in the table will be deleted *permanently and without confirmation***

## Joins

- A join is a method of "joining" two tables together
- This is useful if your database is fully normalised, and so you may need data from two or more tables for a single query
- `INNER JOIN` or `JOIN`
  - The default type of join, which is used when not specifying the type
  - Returns all records that have a matching value in both tables
  - ![Venn diagram, A and B, intersection of A and B is highlighted](resources/inner.png)
- `LEFT [OUTER] JOIN`
  - Returns all records in the left table, and any matching records from the right table
  - ![Venn diagram, A and B, all of A and intersection of B is highlighted](resources/left.png)
- `RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN`
  - Returns all records in the right table, and any matching records from the left table
  - ![Venn diagram, A and B, all of B and intersection of A is highlighted](resources/right.png)
- `FULL [OUTER] JOIN`
  - Returns all records which match the `WHERE` statement in either table
  - ![Venn diagram, A and B, all of A and B is highlighted, including the intersection](resources/full-outer.png)

## Functions

### Date Functions

- `NOW()`
  - Returns a `TIMESTAMP` containing the current date and time according to the DBMS
- `CURRENT_DATE`
  - Returns a `DATE` containing the current date according to the DBMS
- `DATE_PART([part], [column])`
  - Returns the specified part of a `TIMESTAMP`
  - e.g. `SELECT DATE_PART('year', dob)` would return only the year part of the column dob
  - The different parts of a date that can be extracted are as follows:
    - decade
    - year
    - month
    - day
    - hour
    - minute
    - second
    - day of week
- `AGE([column])`
  - Returns the difference between the timestamp in the column specified and now, can be used to get a persons age given a date of birth
- `AGE([column1], [column2])`
  - Returns the difference between the timestamp in column1 and column2
  - column2 should be earlier than column1
- `DATE_TRUNC([part], [column])`
  - Returns a `TIMESTAMP`, truncated to the level specified. Levels of truncation are the same as those in the `DATE_PART()` function

### Text Functions

- `ASCII([character])`
  - Returns the ASCII value of the character specified
  - Expects only one character
- `CHR([integer])`
  - Returns the character represented by the ASCII code entered
  - Expects only one value
- `POSITION([character] IN [string])`
  - Returns the first occurrence of the character specified within the string
  - 1-indexed, for some reason
- `FORMAT([format], [token1], [token2], [...])`
  - Functions almost identically to the `printf()` function in C
  - e.g. `FORMAT('Hello, %s', user.forename)` would return "Hello, Hugh"
- `INITCAP([string])`
  - Returns the string formatted into title case
  - e.g. `INITCAP("i am a student at the university of portsmouth")` would return "I Am A Student At The University Of Portsmouth"
- `CONCAT([string1], [separator1], [string2], [separator2], [...])`
  - Returns a single string with all of the strings or columns concatenated together, with the separators specified
- `CONCAT_WS([separator], [string1], [string2], [...])`
  - Returns a single string with all of the strings or columns concatenated together, with the separator specified
  - Performs the same function as `CONCAT`, but you only need to specify one separator which is then reused for each additional string

### Mathematical Functions

- `MIN([column])`
  - Returns a single value, being the minimum value in the column specified
- `MAX([column])`
  - Returns a single value, being the maximum value in the column specified
- `AVG([column])`
  - Returns a single value, being the average of every value in the column specified
- `RANDOM()`
  - Returns a single floating point value between 0 and 1
  - To get a value between certain numbers, you can multiply and add to the random value
    - e.g. A random number between 100 and 200 could be obtained using `RANDOM() * 100 + 100`
