1. Write a query that puts the genre, the author's full name and the titles of the books they have written for all of the action books. The name and title must be displayed in a single column with the heading "Title and Author"

```sql
SELECT CONCAT_WS(' ', b.title, a.authorfname, a.authorlname) AS "Title and Author" FROM book b
JOIN bookgenre bg ON b.isbn = bg.isbn
JOIN wrote w ON b.isbn = w.wroteisbn
JOIN author a ON w.authorid = a.authorid
WHERE bg.genreid = 4;
```
```
                 Title and Author
---------------------------------------------------
 BALANCED ACTUATING INSTRUCTION SET Bobbye Valois
 RIGHT-SIZED LOCAL INTRANET Sara Hurll
 RIGHT-SIZED LOCAL INTRANET Brendin Amberger
 BALANCED ACTUATING INSTRUCTION SET Linet Aberhart
 RIGHT-SIZED LOCAL INTRANET Odelle Cannaway
 OPTIONAL VALUE-ADDED OPEN SYSTEM Gayelord Croom
```

2. There are some common first names in the author table. Write a query that would return only a single row of data for each individual name

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(authorfname) FROM author;
```
```
 authorfname
-------------
 Roxie
 Fleming
 Faina
 Linet
 Serena
 Kearney
 Collen
 Phyllis
 Sherlock
 Noach
 ...
 ```

3. How many rows of data would be returned by the query in 2?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(authorfname)) FROM author;
```
```
 count 
-------
    28
```

4. How many authors are there in total?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(authorid) FROM author;
```
```
 count 
-------
    30
```

5. How many customers have a middle name?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(mname) FROM libuser;
```
```
 count 
-------
    14
```

6. Do we have any authors in our system that do not appear to have written any book that we have on the shelves? List their full names, surname first with a comma as a separator using concatenation, giving the column the title of "Author but no books"

```sql
SELECT CONCAT_WS(',', a.authorlname, a.authorfname) AS "Author but no books" FROM author a
LEFT JOIN wrote w ON a.authorid = w.authorid
WHERE w.authorid IS NULL;
```
```
 Author but no books 
---------------------
 Trude,Roxie
 Burgan,Fleming
 Youens,Malinda
 Findlow,Wilmette
 O'Carroll,Phyllis
 Boxhall,Faina
```

7. List any library users full names and their email addresses that have never taken a book out of the library. Show another piece of data that proves that your query is giving exactly the answer you are asked for

```sql
SELECT CONCAT_WS(' ', u.fname, u.lname) AS "Name", u.emailaddress AS "Email Address" FROM libuser u
LEFT JOIN loan l ON u.librarynumber = l.loanlibrarynumb
WHERE l.loanlibrarynumb IS NULL;
```
```

8. List the author's full names putting them into last name reverse alphabetical order

```sql
SELECT CONCAT_WS(' ', a.authorfname, a.authorlname) AS "Full name" FROM author a
ORDER BY a.authorlname DESC;
```
```
       Full name

```

9. List the authorâ€™s full names whose first name begins with the letter B. Sort the results into the same order as in 8

```sql
SELECT CONCAT_WS(' ', a.authorfname, a.authorlname) AS "Full name" FROM author a
WHERE SUBSTRING(a.authorfname, 1, 1) = 'B'
ORDER BY a.authorlname DESC;
```

10. List the books that have a genre. Sort the books into alphabetical order

```sql
SELECT b.title, g.genre FROM book b

WHERE bg.isbn IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY g.genre ASC;

11. Now sort the output for 10 into descending genreid order

```sql
SELECT b.title, g.genre FROM book b
LEFT JOIN bookgenre bg ON b.isbn = bg.isbn
JOIN genre g ON bg.genreid = g.genreid
WHERE bg.isbn IS NOT NULL
