# Database Systems Development - Lecture 29/09/22

- Mark Venn (Module Coordinator), Valentin Adamescu (Tutor) and Roy Abraham (Tutor)
- Module is designed to help understand where the database sits in modern systems and why it's important

- Teaches you:
 - How databases are designed and how to safely access them from another application
 - How to design and build a relational database given a set of requirements
 - To understand how to apply data manipulation using SQL

- Lecture notes are uploaded to Moodle if you miss a lecture for any reason - this should be read through before the practical session in that week or the next (depending upon timetabling)
- Practical sessions are timetabled for 2 hours but the last 30 minutes are optional if you need to ask any questions or require help

- Total of 4 hours a week of study (an hour in the lecture and 1:30 in practical sessions)

## Assessments

- Coursework is released during TB1 and is due in during the first week of TB2
- Exams are during the end of the year assessment period

## What is a database?

- A single, possibly large collection of data that can be used by multiple departments or users concurrently
- Essentially a collection of tables containing data which is in some way related
- Access is not a database as it lacks any data integrity verification
- A DBMS (Database Management System) is the software that interacts with the users' applications and database (acts like the middle man)
 - Examples are PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle and MongoDB

- Why use a database?
 - Modern approach
 - Always digital
 - Duplicates are removed automatically
 - Searching is easy
 - Updates are more easily done
 - Access control is much easier and more secure
 - Ensures data integrity
