## How do quantum computers work?
IBM has just unveiled a new quantum computer known as [Osprey](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2022-11-09-IBM-Unveils-400-Qubit-Plus-Quantum-Processor-and-Next-Generation-IBM-Quantum-System-Two)
  - Osprey has 433 qubits, which is more than 3 times the number of their previous computer, announced in 2021
- Need to define "powerful" within this context
  - Quantum computers are not powerful in the typical sense - they are much more efficient at running specifically designed algorithms, such as [Shor's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm)
  - Unlike previous generation quantum computers such as IBM's Eagle, Osprey is reprogrammable while it's turned on, allowing for more complex computation [Citation Needed]

## Encryption algorithms
- RSA-250 (829 bits) was factored in 2700 core years of a Xeon Gold 6130 CPU [ref](https://web.archive.org/web/20200228234716/https://lists.gforge.inria.fr/pipermail/cado-nfs-discuss/2020-February/001166.html)
- Quantum computer using Shor's algorithm factorises 15 48% of the time [ref](https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5707)
