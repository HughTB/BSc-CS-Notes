# CCC Item 1 Script Draft 1 - Hugh Baldwin 2022

During their conversation, Max says "lots of people talk about Qubits but I'm not quite sure what they are". So, what is a qubit? Well as the name suggests, it is the quantum equivalent of a bit (qubit meaning quantum-bit). Qubits are used by quantum computers in the same way that a classical computer uses a bit, to store data. Where they differ, however, is that while a bit can store either a 1 or a 0, a qubit can be in a combination of both 1 and 0 at the same time, this is known as a superposition.
  
So now we've got another question, what is a superposition? Essentially, a superposition is a property of quantum particles (such as the ones used to create qubits) which allows them to be in multiple states at the same time, with different probabilities. For example, one of the qubits in a quantum computer might be in a state of 70% |1⟩ and 30% |0⟩, meaning that when the value of the qubit is measured, there is a 70% chance of the result being a 1 and a 30% chance of being a 0. It is impossible to know the state of a qubit until it is measured, and "collapses" into one of the two states. This doesn't sound like it would be very useful for a computer, right? Well as it turns out, it allows quantum computers to be much faster and more efficient than classical computers when running specifically designed algorithms. This is because a set of n qubits can be in a superposition of all 2<sup>n</sup> states at once, which gives the possibility of much more complex algorithms, or the ability to calculate all possible combinations of inputs at once, and only output one answer (known as quantum parallelism).
  
By using qubits in superposition, we can create quantum computers exponentially more "powerful" than current classical computers. But what does "powerful" really mean? In the context of classical computing, you might say a computer is "more powerful" because it's able to run a video game at a higher resolution or render a video faster. No quantum computer that currently exists, and probably none made in the near future, could even come close to running Crysis (haha) or rendering a video, and yet they're prescribed as "the next big leap in computing". Well, that's because quantum computers are much faster at certain tasks, such as factoring prime numbers or searching databases, but some algorithms simply do not translate.
  
But why does it matter that quantum computers can factorise numbers quickly? Well, as suggested by Max, "a quantum computer (...) could break most, if not all, current cryptographic algorithms". This is due to the way that most cryptographic algorithms (almost all symmetric-key algorithms) work, as they rely upon the fact that it is easy for a computer to multiply numbers together, but not to find the prime numbers that were used to get that number in the first place. This is all well and good for a classical computer, but a quantum computer using Shor's Algorithm is exponentially faster at finding prime factors, meaning that any data encrypted using a symmetric-key algorithm such as RSA would be at risk of being decrypted by a quantum computer. While this probably isn't an issue for you or me, it could still be a problem for outdated systems such as those used by companies and governments.
