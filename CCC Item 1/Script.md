# CCC Item 1 Script Draft 1 - Hugh Baldwin 2022

During their conversation, Max says "lots of people talk about Qubits but I'm not quite sure what they are". So, what is a qubit? Well as the name suggests, it is the quantum equivalent of a bit (qubit meaning quantum-bit). Qubits are used by quantum computers in the same way that a classical computer uses a bit, to store data. Where they differ, however, is that while a bit can store either a 1 or a 0, a qubit can be in a combination of both 1 and 0 at the same time, this is known as a superposition.
  
So now we've got another question, what is a superposition? Essentially, a superposition is a property of quantum particles (such as the ones used to create qubits) which allows them to be in multiple states at the same time, with different probabilities. For example, one of the qubits in a quantum computer might be in a state of 70% |1⟩ and 30% |0⟩, meaning that when the value of the qubit is measured, there is a 70% chance of the result being a 1 and a 30% chance of being a 0. It is impossible to know the state of a qubit until it is measured, and "collapses" into one of the two states. This doesn't sound like it would be very useful for a computer, right? Well as it turns out, it allows quantum computers to be much faster and more efficient than classical computers when running specifically designed algorithms. This is because a set of n qubits can be in a superposition of all $2^n$ states at once, which gives the possibility of much more complex algorithms, or the ability to calculate all possible combinations of inputs at once, and only output one answer (known as quantum parallelism).
  
By using qubits in superposition, we can create quantum computers exponentially more "powerful" than current classical computers. But what does "powerful" really mean? In the context of classical computing, you might say a computer is "more powerful" because it's able to run a video game at a higher resolution or render a video faster. No quantum computer that currently exists, and probably none made in the near future, could even come close to running Crysis (haha) or rendering a video, and yet they're prescribed as "the next big leap in computing". Well, that's because quantum computers are much faster at certain tasks, such as factoring prime numbers or searching databases.

But why does it matter that quantum computers can factorise numbers quickly? Well, as suggested by Max, "a quantum computer (...) could break most, if not all, current cryptographic algorithms". This is partially true, but it's much more nuanced than it would at first appear. There are many different methods of encrypting data, but unfortunately, the most commonly used method (asymmetric or public-key encryption) is known to be vulnerable to quantum computers. This is due to the way that algorithms such as RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) work. Such algorithms use two distinct, but related, numbers to encrypt and decrypt the data. These are known as the public and private keys. As the names suggest, the public key can be known by anyone, as it's used to encrypt the data (oh no, don't send me more data!) but the private key must remain a secret, else someone other than the intended recipient could decrypt the message. The public and private keys are usually each made up of a prime number (normally very large numbers with a similar magnitude) and the product of the two prime numbers, such that $p * q = n$.

And this, finally, is where quantum computers come into play and ruin everything. Using only the public key, it is theoretically possible to calculate the private key, and thus "break" the encryption. Given that the public key is made up of one prime number, $p$, and the product, we'll call this $n$, of $p$ and the other prime number, $q$, all that the computer needs to do to "break" the encryption is factorise $n$ to get the two primes $p$ and $q$. That doesn't sound too hard, right? Maybe not for you or me with a very small number such as 15, which is the product of 3 and 5, but for classical computers and numbers as large as those used in encryption, the problem quickly grows out of hand. For example, it took a supercomputer 2700 core years to factorize RSA-250, a number with 250 digits, into its component primes. What this essentially means is that if you used a 250-digit number to encrypt some data, that data would be safe from me using my quad-core laptop for roughly 700 years. On the other hand, a sufficiently advanced quantum computer using Shor's algorithm (a very fast, quantum algorithm which I don't have time to explain) would take a matter of minutes to break the same encryption.
