### Week 8 in class assessment
- 1st part (7 marks)
 - Create a window of a certain size (different for each test)
 - Split the window into separate sections in logic
 - Detect when the user clicks and get which section they clicked intern
 - Depending upon where the user clicked, change the properties of the circles
 - Count the number of circles
- 2nd part (3 marks)
 - Create a copy of the code in from the first part
 - Circles follow the same rules as in the 1st part, but rather than drawing where the user clicks, draw in a specified grid pattern
 - Designed to test your understanding of for loops (nested for loops, etc)
- Can get marked down for (only one or two marks):
 - Poor use of for loops
 - Repetition of code
 - Poor use of if statements
 - Bad variable names
