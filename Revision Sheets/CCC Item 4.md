# CCC Item 4 (Key Concepts of Usability)

## Human Computer Interaction (HCI)

- The study of interactions between humans and computers (machines generally)
- Major Goals
  - Improve the interactions between people and machines
  - Make computers more usable
  - Make computers more receptive to users' needs
- The scope of HCI is large, and ever-growing. As such, it covers many different areas of computer science and other subjects such as Psychology and Design
- There are 3 main sub-domains of HCI
  - Usability
    - Refers to how successfully can a user accomplish a specific goal using the system
    - Concerned with making systems easy to learn and use, as well as limiting errors
  - User Experience (UX)
    - UX encompasses the users' entire experience with an interface
    - This includes not only the design and functionality of the interface, but also how users expect the interface to function
  - User Centred Design
    - UCD is a design process in which the design is iterated upon several times based on feedback from users
- Why is HCI important?
  - Badly designed interfaces can be confusing or time-consuming to use, which increases the likelihood of users abandoning the system and using a competitor
  - Since the way we interact with computers and other machines changes constantly, we need to research ways to improve the interactions and make them as intuitive as possible

### HCI Paradigms

- There are a few main paradigms for HCI, including new paradigms we are yet to fully exploit
- Command Line Interfaces (CLI)
  - Entirely text-based interface, reminiscent of computers from the 80s
  - Still used in legacy applications, or when greater administrative control is required
- Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)
  - Often use a desktop metaphor
  - Typically uses a point-and-click interface with a mouse or other pointing device
- Natural User Interfaces (NUI)
  - Uses intuitive actions to control a system. The machine adapts to humans rather than the other way around, as with CLI and GUI
  - There are many forms of NUI, but the most common are voice control, touch screens, gesture recognition, eye tracking, etc
- The "Metaverse"
  - Typically refers to a virtual world which mimics real life
  - Two main methods of interacting with the metaverse, namely AR (Augmented Reality) and VR (Virtual Reality)

### Interface Design

- User Interface design is another important part of HCI
- Designers must consider a wide range of factors
  - User Expectations
  - What is enjoyable/attractive
  - Limitations of the device(s) the interface will be used on
  - Limitations of the back-end of the application
- User Interface is the part of a computer system that end users interact with
- A good user interface will not be noticed, as it uses a good balance of input and output methods to create an intuitive and pleasing interface
- A bad user interface causes frustration when it breaks users' expectations or forces them to adapt to the poor design

## Usability Heuristics

- Nielsen's heuristics are a set of principles for evaluating the usability of an interface, and were created by Jakob Nielsen in 1990
### 1\. Match Between the System and the Real World
- The system should use concepts and phrases which are familiar to the user, as well as following real-world design conventions and using metaphors where possible
### 2\. Consistency and Standards
- Words and symbols should always mean the same thing throughout the interface, to reduce confusion and improve the intuitiveness of the interface
### 3\. Visibility of System Status
- The system should keep the user informed of it's status. This could be as simple as a progress bar or loading animation to show that the interface is not frozen
### 4\. User Control and Freedom
- Users often make mistakes, so there should be undo or cancel buttons wherever possible, especially in places where data could be lost or corrupted
### 5\. Error Prevention
- It is much more user friendly to prevent errors rather than recovering from them. This could be in the form of validating inputs before they are sent, or giving users a second chance to check before submitting
### 6\. Help Users Recognise, Diagnose and Recover From Errors
- Error messages should be displayed in as plain English as possible, and hide technical information behind a "more info" button or similar
### 7\. Recognition Rather Than Recall
- The user should not have to remember the entire interface to use it. As such, information needed to use the interface should be clearly displayed at all times
### 8\. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
- Accelerators should be added to the application, which go unnoticed by regular users, but allow much greater productivity for power users. This could be as simple as key bindings or as complex as intellisense
### 9\. Aesthetic and Documentation
- Dialogues should only contain the necessary information, as it is easy to overload users with graphics and jargon
### 10\. Help and Documentation
- It is always best for a system to be usable without documentation, but it is still very useful for new users or advanced users performing an uncommon task
