## HCI and Usability

- HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) is the study of interactions between people and computers
- The advent of IOT means that HCI is becoming the study of interactions between people and machines generally
- Major Goals
  - To improve the interactions between people and machines
  - Making computers more usable
  - Make computers more receptive to users' needs
- Long Term Goal
  - To design systems that minimize the barrier between what users want to accomplish and what the computer understands
- HCI is a very broad field which covers many areas of computer science and other subjects such as Psychology and Design

### Usability, UX and User Centred Design

- There are 3 main sub-domains of HCI
  - Usability
    - Usability is one of the key concepts in HCI and refers primarily to how successfully a user can use a system to accomplish a specific goal
    - Concerned with making systems easy to learn and use, and limiting errors and reducing the severity of the errors
  - User Experience (UX)
    - UX encompasses the user's entire experience with an interface
    - This includes not just how the interface does work, but also how they were expecting it to work, how they feel about using it, and how they feel about the system overall
  - User Centred Design (UCD)
    - UCD is an iterative process in which designers focus on the needs of users
    - Users are involved during the whole design process with a variety of research and design techniques

### Why is HCI important?

- HCI is important because if a uses does not understand the interface, or finds it annoying, they are likely to stop using it
- With web apps and desktop software, the principles of good UI have been understood since the 1990s
- So why is HCI often overlooked?
  - Functionality is often prioritized over usability or user experience
  - Budget and time constraints often lead to rushed development, meaning that the important features are implemented first and the user interface is left behind
  - Usability and UX are often forgotten about or intentionally ignored when planning development of new software
- The introduction of new technologies such as VR and the Metaverse mean that HCI is a much bigger concern, and they bring new issues that haven't needed to be solved before

## HCI Paradigms

- There are a few main paradigms for HCI
  - Command Line Interfaces (CLI)
    - Users directly input commands into a text-based interface
  - Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)
    - User manipulates graphical representation of applications, usually using a mouse
  - Natural User Interfaces (NUI)
    - Devices such as the connect which simulate more real-world interactions
  - "Metaverse"

### CLIs

- CLIs are entirely text-based
- Users control the computer or application by entering commands with a keyboard
- Originally, most user interfaces were CLIs (Namely DOS, Unix, Linux, BASIC)
- CLIs are still used with terminal emulators in modern operating systems, but this is usually limited to more administrative tasks

### GUIs

- Often use a desktop metaphor
- Based on point-and-click using a mouse or other pointing device
- Not much has changed since 1984, when the first Apple Macintosh was introduced with a GUI

### NUIs

- A Natural User Interface is a system that uses intuitive actions such as touch, gestures or voice control
- It relies on a user being able to perform relatively natural gestures to control an application or manipulate content
- The idea of NUIs is that rather than adapting our expectations to the capabilities of computers, we adapt the user interfaces to accommodate what we naturally understand
- NUI has always been an ideal concept for HCI, but was greatly limited by the capabilities of technology available in the past
- NUIs come in many forms
  - Speech Recognition, aka Voice Control
    - Already used in devices such as Google Home devices or Siri
  - Brain-Machine Interface
  - Touch Screens
    - Currently the most common type of NUI, as it's very widely used in Mobile Phones, Tablets and Laptops
  - Gesture Recognition
    - Involves tracking in some way the movement of the body
    - Can use cameras such as the Kinect, or could use accelerometers such as Wiimotes or PS Move controllers
  - Gaze / Eye Tracking
    - Often accomplished using a camera, and estimates where on the screen the user is looking

### "Metaverse"

- A metaverse typically refers to a virtual world which mimics the real world, in which people socialise and in some cases work
- There are two common ways of interacting with the metaverse, VR and AR
  - Virtual Reality is where the user's entire view is taken up by the head-mounted display, and everything is simulated
  - Augmented Reality is where the user can still see the real world, but is also able to see and interact with some virtual objects

## Interface Design

- User interface design is another of the sub-domains of HCI
- Designers must consider a wide variety of factors
  - Users' expectations
  - What is enjoyable to use
  - Aesthetic design
  - Limitations of the devices the interface will be used on
  - Limitations of the back-end of the application
- What is the user interface?
  - The parts of the software that the users can see and interact with
  - i.e. the input and output of the software
  - A good interface provides a mixture of well-designed input and output methods that satisfy the users' needs and expectations
  - The best interface is one that is not noticed and allows the users to get on with their task
  - A bad interface often causes more issues than it solves, as users become frustrated when it breaks their expectations or is hard for them to use
